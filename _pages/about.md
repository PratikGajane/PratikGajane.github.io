Welcome to my professional webpage.

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/) at the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/). I obtained my PhD in the topic of [sequential learning with partial feedback](https://lilloa.univ-lille.fr/handle/20.500.12210/23555?locale-attribute=en) at [INRIA SequeL](https://team.inria.fr/sequel/) and [Université de Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr/) under the supervision of [Prof. Philippe Preux](https://philippe-preux.github.io/) and [Dr. Tanguy Urvoy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanguy22/). I received my master’s degree in Computer Science & Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) under the supervison of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/people/b-ravindran/).

My [Erdös number](https://www.oakland.edu/enp/) is 3 thanks to Peter Auer (-> Pal Revesz -> Paul Erdös).

My research interests span across sequential decision-making and machine learning with ethical considerations such as fairness and privacy.

In sequential decision-making, I seek to understand how an intelligent agent “learns” from its interactions with the environment. Generally, I am interested in devising machine learning algorithms with strong mathematical foundations which can work with non-standard forms of feedback often encountered in real-life scenarios. 

Secondly, I am also interested in interdisciplinary research with the aim of incorporating human aspects like fairness and privacy in machine learning.

* As the lead organizer and presenter, I delivered a tutorial on advances in fairness-aware reinforcement learning, partnering with Mykola Pechenizkiy and Yingqian Zhang at [the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) 2024](https://ijcai24.org/). See additional information about the tutorial, including the slides at [https://fair-rl.github.io/](https://fair-rl.github.io/). 
* A paper accepted at the ICML 2024 Workshop on Models of Human Feedback for AI Alignment. In this paper, we introduced the problem of regret minimization in adversarial multi-dueling
bandits. Our work addresses a gap in the literature by considering scenarios where the learner selects multiple arms at each round and observes the identity of the most preferred arm, based on arbitrary preference matrices. We propose a novel algorithm and prove that its expected cumulative regret is upper-bounded by $O((K \log K)^{1/3} T^{2/3})$. We also establish a matching lower bound of $\Omega(K^{1/3} T^{2/3})$. See the paper at [arxiv:2406.12475](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12475).
* I gave a talk at [the Conference on Advancing Behavioral Science through AI and Digital Health](https://michr.umich.edu/new-events/2024/5/21/advancing-behavioral-science-through-ai-and-digital-health) held in Ann Arbor, MI, USA. The topic was reinforcement learning-driven pain care recommendations. Here are the [slides](https://pratikgajane.github.io/files/BRISP_2024.pdf). <span style="color:lightgray"> (May 2024)</span>.
* Mykola Pechenizkiy, Yingqian Zhang and I will be delivering a tutorial on the advances in fairness-aware reinforcement learning at [the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) 2024](https://ijcai24.org/). In this tutorial, we will present advances in fairness-aware reinforcement learning encompassing theoretical results as well as real-world applications. We plan to cover motivating applications and technical details of incorporating fairness objectives into the reinforcement learning model, analyze fairness in reinforcement learning as multi-objective optimization, and explore impactful future directions. See you all in Jeju!  <span style="color:lightgray"> (Apr 2024)</span>.
* I have been invited to give a talk at [the Conference on Advancing Behavioral Science through AI and Digital Health](https://michr.umich.edu/new-events/2024/5/21/advancing-behavioral-science-through-ai-and-digital-health).

* A pre-print detailing some of our initial work in my ongoing collocation with [Prof John D. Piette](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/piette-john.html) is online - [arxiv:2402.19226](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19226). Here our focus is on identifying (and rectifying) gender bias in personalized recommendations for pain care. In this initial work, we show that if certain patient information, such as self-reported pain measurements, is not considered in the decision-making process, then the quality of reinforcement learning-driven pain care recommendations for women can be notably inferior to those for men. <span style="color:lightgray"> (Mar 2024)</span>.
