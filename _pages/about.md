Welcome to my professional webpage.

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the department of [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/) at the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/). I obtained my PhD in the topic of [sequential learning with partial feedback](https://lilloa.univ-lille.fr/handle/20.500.12210/23555?locale-attribute=en) at [INRIA SequeL](https://team.inria.fr/sequel/) and [Université de Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr/) under the supervision of [Prof. Philippe Preux](https://philippe-preux.github.io/) and [Dr. Tanguy Urvoy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanguy22/). I received my master’s degree in Computer Science & Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) under the supervison of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/people/b-ravindran/).

My [Erdös number](https://www.oakland.edu/enp/) is 3 thanks to Peter Auer (-> Pal Revesz -> Paul Erdös).

My research interests span across sequential decision making and fairness in machine learning.

In sequential decision making, I seek to understand how an intelligent agent “learns” from its interactions with the environment. Generally, I am interested in devising machine learning algorithms with strong mathematical foundations which can work with incomplete forms of feedback often encountered in real-life scenarios. 

The second important thread in my research is fairness in machine learning(fair-ML) which deals with removing bias from the decisions made by the ML algorithms. Here, I am generally interested in posing Fair-ML as policy learning in sequential setting while considering various fairness measures.
