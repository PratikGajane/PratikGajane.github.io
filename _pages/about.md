Welcome to my professional webpage.

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/) at the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/). I obtained my PhD in the topic of [sequential learning with partial feedback](https://lilloa.univ-lille.fr/handle/20.500.12210/23555?locale-attribute=en) at [INRIA SequeL](https://team.inria.fr/sequel/) and [Université de Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr/) under the supervision of [Prof. Philippe Preux](https://philippe-preux.github.io/) and [Dr. Tanguy Urvoy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanguy22/). I received my master’s degree in Computer Science & Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) under the supervison of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/people/b-ravindran/).

My [Erdös number](https://www.oakland.edu/enp/) is 3 thanks to Peter Auer (-> Pal Revesz -> Paul Erdös).

My research interests span across sequential decision-making and machine learning with ethical considerations such as fairness and privacy.

In sequential decision-making, I seek to understand how an intelligent agent “learns” from its interactions with the environment. Generally, I am interested in devising machine learning algorithms with strong mathematical foundations which can work with non-standard forms of feedback often encountered in real-life scenarios. 

Secondly, I am also interested in interdisciplinary research with the aim of incorporating human aspects like fairness and privacy in machine learning.

* Mykola Pechenizkiy, Yingqian Zhang and I will be delivering a tutorial on the advances in fairness-aware reinforcement learning at [the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) 2024](https://ijcai24.org/). See you all in Jeju!
* I have been invited to give a talk at [the Conference on Advancing Behavioral Science through AI and Digital Health](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/event/advancing-behavioral-science-through-ai-and-digital-health-an-e-hail-joint-event/). I will be speaking on reinforcement learning-driven healthcare recommendations. <span style="color:lightgray"> (Mar 2024)</span>.
* A pre-print detailing some of our initial work in my ongoing collocation with [Prof John D. Piette](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/piette-john.html) is online - [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19226](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19226). Here our focus is on identifying (and rectifying) gender bias in personalized recommendations for pain care. In this initial work, we show that if certain patient information, such as self-reported pain measurements, is not considered in the decision-making process, then the quality of reinforcement learning-driven pain care recommendations for women can be notably inferior to those for men. <span style="color:lightgray"> (Mar 2024)</span>.
* A paper accepeted at the Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2024). Under my guidance, Ronald C. van den Broek, Rik Litjens, Tobias Sagis, Luc Siecker, and Nina Verbeeke collaborated to produce this paper as a culmination of their course project <span style="color:lightgray"> (Jan 2024)</span>.

* Our joint work with Dr. Peter Auer and Dr. Ronad Ortner has been accepted at the 32nd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), 2023. In this work, we propose a meta-algorithm which can convert any RL algorithm with sublinear regret into an exploration algorithm with suitable guarantees on its sample complexity <span style="color:lightgray"> (Apr 2023)</span>.
