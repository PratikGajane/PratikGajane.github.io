Welcome to my professional webpage.

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the department of Computer Science at the University of Leoben. I work with Prof. Peter Auer and Prof. Ronald Ortner on the topic of dynamically evolving MDPs and reinforcement learning. My current research is mainly supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): I 3437-N33.

On a broader level, I seek to understand how an intelligent agent “learns” from its interactions with the environment. Generally, I am interested in devising machine learning algorithms with strong mathematical foundations which can work with incomplete forms of feedback often encountered in real-life scenarios. Which algorithms can be used to learn from the various kinds of feedback that the environment can provide the agent? Can we model the algorithms to exploit the structure of the game so that they are able to learn in a better way? What are the performance guarantees of these algorithms? A key interest of mine is to prove lower bounds on the performance measures for the problems as it would let us know when to stop looking for better algorithms, and to instead look for better problems.
