Welcome to my professional webpage.

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Eindhoven University of Technology. My research interests span across reinforcement learning and fairness in machine learning.

In reinforcement learning, I seek to understand how an intelligent agent “learns” from its interactions with the environment. Generally, I am interested in devising machine learning algorithms with strong mathematical foundations which can work with incomplete forms of feedback often encountered in real-life scenarios. Which algorithms can be used to learn from the various kinds of feedback that the environment can provide the agent? Can we model the algorithms to exploit the structure of the game so that they are able to learn in a better way? What are the performance guarantees of these algorithms? 

The second important thread in my research is fairness in machine learning(fair-ML) which deals with removing bias from the decisions made by the ML algorithms. Here, I am generally interested in posing Fair-ML as policy learning in sequential setting while considering various fairness measures.
