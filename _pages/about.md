Welcome to my professional webpage.

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/) at the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/). I obtained my PhD in the topic of [sequential learning with partial feedback](https://lilloa.univ-lille.fr/handle/20.500.12210/23555?locale-attribute=en) at [INRIA SequeL](https://team.inria.fr/sequel/) and [Université de Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr/) under the supervision of [Prof. Philippe Preux](https://philippe-preux.github.io/) and [Dr. Tanguy Urvoy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanguy22/). I received my master’s degree in Computer Science & Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) under the supervison of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/people/b-ravindran/).

My [Erdös number](https://www.oakland.edu/enp/) is 3 thanks to Peter Auer (-> Pal Revesz -> Paul Erdös).

My research interests span across sequential decision-making and machine learning with ethical considerations such as fairness and privacy.

In sequential decision-making, I seek to understand how an intelligent agent “learns” from its interactions with the environment. Generally, I am interested in devising machine learning algorithms with strong mathematical foundations which can work with incomplete forms of feedback often encountered in real-life scenarios. This paper is the culmination of a course project completed by Ronald C. van den Broek, Rik Litjens, Tobias Sagis, Luc Siecker and Nina Verbeeke.

Secondly, I am also interested in interdisciplinary research with the aim of incorporating human aspects like fairness and privacy in machine learning.

* Two papers accepted at the European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL), 2023. The first paper is on sparse-reward deep reinforcement learning with Jiong Li, who is one of my master’s students. The other is on multi-armed bandits where rewards arrive partially and they are observed with different delays. 
  
* Our joint work with Rosa van Tuijn, Tianqin Lu, Emma Driesse, Koen Franken and Dr. Emilia Barakova has been accepted at the 19th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (INTERACT), 2023. In this work, we propose a personalized explainable recommendation device for cardiac rehabilitees.
* Our joint work with Dr. Peter Auer and Dr. Ronad Ortner has been accepted at the 32nd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), 2023. In this work, we propose a meta-algorithm which can convert any RL algorithm with sublinear regret into an exploration algorithm with suitable guarantees on its sample complexity.
* Our joint work with Dennis Collaris, Joost Jorritsma, Mykola Pechenizkiy and Jack (Jarke) van Wijk has been awarded the Runner-up Frontier Prize at the 21st Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2023).
